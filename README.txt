This is the README file for the Virtual Puzzle Game Project.

After downloading the executable, run it in order to access and play the game. If for any reason this doesn't work as intended, you can follow the instructions below that were for a previous version of the project where the level loading system would break only for the executable.

Instructions for older versions:
1) The top level folder, named "Virtual Puzzle Game" and containing this README file, can be opened using Unity Hub with version (6000.0.28f1).
2) Navigate to "File > Build and Run"

The Assets folder contains sub folders for the different assets setup and used throughout the game, including scripts, puzzles and save files.
The Blender folder contains the .blend files used for the 3D models in the project.
